## Functions for testing if cycles are geodesic (also known as isometric)
## cycles. 
##
## A geodesic cycle is a cycle such that the distance along the cycle
## between any pair of nodes in the cycle is the same as their distance 
## in the graph.

## isCycleGeodesic - test if a cycle in a graph g is a geodesic cycle
##
## Paramters:
##    g           - undirected graph object
##    distmatrix  - precomputed distance matrix distances(g)
##    cycle       - nodes in a cycle specified as a vector of nodes in g,
##                  IN ORDER along cycle, so that distance 
##                  in cycle is just cycle difference of their indices
##
## Returns:
##    TRUE if the cycle is geodesic else FALSE
##
## A geodesic cycle is a cycle such that the distance along the cycle
## between any pair of nodes in the cycle is the same as their distance 
## in the graph.
##
## This function tests if the cycle is geodesic simply using the definition.
## Note it does NOT test if the input cycle is actually a cycle, this is a
## precondition.
