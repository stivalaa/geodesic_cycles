Coding and analysis of the "delusional social network" described
(and analyzed with dk-series in Martin 2017) in:

	Minds: Multiple Personality and Schizophrenia." Pp. 122-146 in Method
	in Madness: Case Studies in Neuropsychiatry, edited by Peter
	W. Halligan and John C. Marshall.

The figures in David et al. (1996) and reproduced in Martin (2018) are
hand-drawn by "Patricia"; data here I coded manually from the figures
in the original.

All networks are undirected, coded initially as adjacency lists
for ease of transcription from figures. Whitespace delimited,
one line for each node, the first field is the name of the node,
subsequent fields on the line are nodes adjacent to that node.
Lines are in alphabetical order (by the first field i.e. the node whose
neighbours are listed) and edges are not repeated (i.e. entries are only
present from lower to higher alphabetical order; the reverse is implied as
undirected). Order (after the first field) in a line is not significant.

patricia1990_adjlist.txt
               adjacency lists for the 1990 network coded
               from David et al. (1996) Fig. 7.1(a) (p. 136). 14 nodes
               and 18 edges.

patricia1990_nodelist.txt
               just the list of node names from the 1990 network (above).

patricia1992_adjlist.txt
               adjacency lists fro the 1992 network coded from David et al.
               (1996) Fig 7.1(b) (p. 137). For nodes with no name,
               U_1, U_2, etc. is used. 85 nodes.

patricia1992_nodelist.txt
               just the list of node names from the 1992 network (above)

patricia1992_attributes.txt
               whitespace delimited attributes (with header)
               integrated is 0/1 for shaded ("integrated alters")
               christian is 0/1 for asterisk "Christian alters")
               number (float) is the number (age?) on some nodes or NA
               sphere is 0/1 for in the 'sphere of the blue flame'

patricia1993_adjlist.txt
               adjacency lists fro the 1992 network coded from David et al.
               (1996) Fig 7.1(c) (p. 138). For new nodes with no name,
               Z_1, Z_2, etc. is used. U_2 is the remaining unnamed node
               from 1992; U_1 is now named MANDY and U_3 is now named LOU_LOU.

patricia1993_nodelist.txt
               just the list of node names from the 1993 network (above)

patricia1993_attributes.txt
               whitespace delimited attributes (with header)
               integrated is 0/1 for shaded ("integrated alters")
               christian is 0/1 for asterisk "Christian alters")
               number (float) is the number (age?) on some nodes or NA
               sphere is 0/1 for in the 'sphere of the blue flame'
               behind is 0/1 for the component marked 'behind' on drawing.
               Note that 'integrated' and 'christian' and 'number' are
               from the 1992 diagram (where nodes with same name are on both)
               as the 1993 diagram does not have these attributes.
