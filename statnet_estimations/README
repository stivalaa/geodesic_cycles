statnet estimations are run on hpc.ics.usi.ch as that has
Microsoft R Open 3.2.5
where statnet just works (and faster than on my laptops) while on the USI
laptop statnet after making me update no longer works in estimations,
keeps getting bogus error about 
"file descriptor is too large for select()" 
while on Dell laptop statnet::update_statnet() failed...
and different versions of ergm objects (like models) are not compatible
so best to just do everything on the one system where it works properly
and copy them back to Google Drive using rsync.

Note that also cycle counting (in particular chordless cycles) uses the 
CYPATH software from http://research.nii.ac.jp/~uno/code/cypath11.zip
but have to edit the transgrh.pl script to add a semicolon on the end of line
38 as it does not work otherwise.
